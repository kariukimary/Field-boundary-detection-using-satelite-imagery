# Field-boundary-detection-using-satelite-imagery
The project aims to integrate crop classification with field boundary detection for precision agriculture. This integration addresses the need for high-quality data to improve agricultural practices in Kenya, particularly in crop classification and field boundary delineation.The initial challenge was the scarcity of adequate, high-resolution data on crop fields, which is critical for accurate analysis. The project is structured in three key phases:
# Phase 1: Building a High-Resolution Cropland Dataset
In this phase, we created a dataset specifically for Kenyan croplands, using satellite index time series. Shapefiles of crop fields were extracted from Google Earth Pro, allowing us to construct a high-resolution dataset to support further analysis.
# Phase 2: Crop Classification
Building on the dataset from Phase 1, this phase focuses on identifying and classifying different crop types using only the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). NDVI, derived from satellite imagery, is used to capture the unique growth patterns and seasonal stages of various crops. Each crop type shows a distinct NDVI time series profile, which enables precise differentiation between crops based on their growth characteristics.
# Phase 3: Integrating Crop Classification with Field Boundary Detection
The final phase combines crop classification results with field boundary detection algorithms, enabling precise delineation of field boundaries. This integration is essential for monitoring crop health and managing resources effectively in precision agriculture.
